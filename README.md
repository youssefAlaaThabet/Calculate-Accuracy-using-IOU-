# Calculate-Accuracy-using-IOU-

-- After labeling your images and getting the detections from the model
-- each image should have a separate text file for its labels. each line in the file corresponds to a detection
-- the detected bounding boxes that correspond to a specific image, should be saved in a separate file.
-- the name of the files of labels should be named as labelsX : where X is the image number
-- the name should be applied for the file of the prediction predX : where X is the image number

-- you should update the first loop to be in the range of your images number
-- also you can update the if statement in the last loop to your prefered IOU by defult it is 0.4
